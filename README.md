# ATCD Choreography Sync

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MPL--2.0-green)](https://github.com/Depau/ATCD-Choreography-Sync/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Build](https://github.com/Depau/atcd_choreo_sync/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Depau/atcd_choreo_sync/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Simple app for both Android (Oculus Quest native) and Windows (PCVR) to
sync [Audio Trip](http://audiotripvr.com/) songs from
the [Audio Trip Choreography Discord](https://atcd.club).

## Installing the app

Download the latest version of the app for your platform from
the [Releases](https://github.com/Depau/atcd_choreo_sync/releases) page.

### Oculus Quest

- Download the Android APK file
- Drag it on the [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) main window

The Quest application will automatically install songs to the Audio Trip folder:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.KinemotikStudios.AudioTripQuest/files/Songs/ATCD Sync
```

### Windows

- There is no installer
- Just double-click `atcd_choreo_sync.exe`

The Windows application will automatically install songs to the Audio Trip folder for PCVR:

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Kinemotik Studios\Audio Trip\Songs\ATCD Sync
```

### macOS

- Extract the zip archive
- Drag and drop the app to `/Applications`, as you normally would

If your precious laptop says that "the app is damaged" you should know it is lying to you. That's
its way of letting you know I refused to pay 100â‚¬/year to Apple for them to vouch this application.

Since Apple will never see a cent from me, if you want to run it anyway, you can open up the "
Terminal" app and run the following command:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/ATCD Choreography Sync.app"
```

Then open Finder, go to Applications, **right-click the app, then click open**.

Notice how I specifically did not type *double-click the app*, I typed *right click the app, then
click open*.

If you are a naughty person and you recognize that if I didn't write it twice, you would have
double-clicked on it, you better star this project and follow me on Instagram :)

The macOS application downloads all songs to your home directory. You need to use SideQuest to push
them to your Quest.

```bash
~/ATCD Choreo Sync
```

### GNU/Linux

- Download the AppImage
- Make it executable (i.e. `chmod +x atcd_choreo_sync-gnulinux-v1.0.0.AppImage`)
- Double-click or `./atcd_choreo_sync-gnulinux-v1.0.0.AppImage`

The Linux application downloads all songs to your home directory. You need to use SideQuest to push
them to your Quest.

```bash
~/ATCD Choreo Sync
```
