macOS verions newer than Catalina will mark any unsigned app as "damaged".

=> Unsigned: it means I didn't pay a ~100â‚¬/year fee to Apple for them to
   allow me to develop macOS apps

Downloading the app from a web browser will have this effect.

To install the application:

- Download the app
- Extract the archive
- Drag and drop the app to Applications
- Run the following command on the Terminal app to remove the "damaged" attribute

  xattr -cr "/Applications/ATCD Choreography Sync.app"

If it still doesn't allow you to open it from launchpad, be sure to visit
"Applications" in Finder, right-click the app and select "Open".

Note: this is not the same as double-clicking the app!

After doing it once, the app should continue to run with no trouble.
